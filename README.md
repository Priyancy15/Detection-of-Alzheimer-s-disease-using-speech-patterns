# Detection-of-Alzheimer-s-disease-using-speech-patterns
This project focuses on early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using advanced deep learning techniques to analyze speech patterns. The goal is to create a robust model that can identify subtle linguistic changes indicative of AD onset, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
